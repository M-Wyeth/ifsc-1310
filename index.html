      <h2>Progressive Enhancement</h2>
      <p>Progressive Enhancement is the technique of building web pages with a focus on content first. By focusing on content and ensuring that, regardless of browser or device,
        the content is available to all users, you create for stability. By only using the bare minimum of externally linked CSS and JavaScript, the designer ensures that the content will
        be accesssable by anyone trying to access the web page. Progressive enhancement is important because it does not matter how fancy you make it look with CSS and JavaScript if 
        is someone is unable to access the content. By ensuring the base content is easily accessible through a solid HTML structure unaffected by the CSS or JS, you are able
        to reach as many people as possible without fear of everything breaking.

        <h2>Microsite Reflection</h2>
        <p>Unfortunately I did not recieve any feedback from a third party for my website. I did, however, take the time for self reflection on it. The thing that stood out to me more than anything was 
          the amount of just blank white space that each article had. Another issue I had was the formatting of my FAQ page, with the black on blue it is slightly hard to read and 
          the small amount of content needed to be organized in a more organized and legible way. Also, I decided that even though I don't like most of the fonts available to me, I should add
          a font just because it both shows that I know how to as well as adds slightly more of a indivualized appearance to my website. I also filled out my contact page and added the image carousel. While these both were
          added as part of a requirement, the image carousel in particular added a lot to my website.
        </p>
        <p>To fix the excessive white space in each of my article posts, I seperated the h2 and paragraph elements from my container so they were no longer flex items. This allowed me
          to adjust the width of the posts and have them in line to reduce the amount of wasted space. For my FAQ page, I definitely could have had a better solution, but I just moved
          the individual posts into posts so they were easier to see and the design across my pages had better continuity. I believe overall this is a pretty marked improvement, but there
          it still has a long way to go if I wanted this to be truly presentable.
