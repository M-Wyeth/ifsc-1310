    <h2>Concept Centaur</h2>
    <p>Like the mythical half-horse, half-man of Greek lore, Concept Centaur combines the best of several technologies to create an innovative whole. The result of exploration by Segway Inc.'s product development team, Concept Centaur will challenge the way you think about four-wheeled transportation.
    </p>
    <p>From time to time Segway's product development team devotes days, or even weeks, to creating new product concepts with the goal of finding a prince among frogs. It's a product exploration process they call "frog kissing." During this time, engineers and designers are encouraged to use any available materials in a very short time frame to prove a concept will work.</p>
    <p>The product development team demonstrated that
         Concept Centaur was a princeâ€”a concept that passed this initial feasibility test, but is not yet ready to become a product. Concept Centaur demonstrates Segway's continued commitment to breakthrough innovation and the innumerable possibilities for the future of personal transportation. </p>
    <h2>WHAT IS THE CENTAUR?</h2>
    <p>Concept Centaur combines proprietary dynamic stabilization technology with advanced propulsion 
        and suspension systems, and an intuitive 
        user interface to create a unique four-wheel
        device that is easily controllable on two
        or four wheel. Its full suspension and 
        aggressive rider positioning provide an exhilarating ride for one or two people while maintaining control over a variety of terrain. Its rugged performance, zero emissions, and quiet operation make it a good low-impact way to explore the world. Its power and versatility make it suitable for a variety of indoor and outdoor 
        recreational and commercial applications.</p>
